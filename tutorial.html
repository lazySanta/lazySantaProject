      <p class="xmas_font">HTML, an acronym for HyperText Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.
Computer language HTML will enable you to create your own Website.<br>
HTML was first developed by British physicist Tim Berners-Lee in 1990.
For creating web pages in HTML, you need an HTML editor.
For creating HTML you need basic building blocks:
  -tag, attribute, element<br>
  TAGS: -Tags separate normal text from HTML code.
      -Tags are contained in less than "<" and greater than ">" angle brackets.
      -Almost every open tag must be closed,
      for example tag for bold format is <b></b>,
      but there are exceptions such as line break <br>.
      -Tag for hyperlink is href.
      -Every HTML file begins with opening tag html
      and closing tag /html inside <> brackets.
      -Most of the HTML pages start with <!DOCTYPE html>
