      <p>HTML, an acronym for HyperText Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.
Computer language HTML will enable you to create your own Website.<br><br>
HTML was first developed by British physicist Tim Berners-Lee in 1990.
For creating web pages in HTML, you need an HTML editor.
For creating HTML you need basic building blocks:
  -tag, attribute, element<br><br>
        TAGS:<br>
        Tags separate normal text from HTML code.<br>
        Tags are contained in less than "<" and greater than ">" angle brackets.<br>
        Almost every open tag must be closed, for example tag for bold format is, but there are exceptions such as line break.<br>
        Tag for hyperlink is href.<br>
        Every HTML file begins with opening tag html and closing tag /html inside <> brackets.<br>
        Most of the HTML pages start with 	&lt; !DOCTYPE html &gt;.<br>
