LazZzy Santa
23CodeStreet-final-project

Welcome to LazZzy Santa game!

As a final project we had the mission of creating a game that explained a little about the internet. We chose to explain a little bit about HTML through a short tutorial, multiple choice questions and a JavaScript game using the idea of colision between Santa and the presents.

1 - Insert your name in the first screen or chose to see who the team is behind this game.

2 - Read the story why Santa lost his sled for the Grinch.

3 - Study our short HTML tutorial.

4 - Play the game moving Santa through the keyboard left and right arrow keys, or in our mobile version using touch screen to position Santa in the present's position. If you didn't get the present at first try, don't worry, another one will fall.

5 - If you got a present, respond the question with the correct answer to continue. If you didn't get the correct answer, you can try again.

6 - After replying 3 questions the game is over and you can also meet the team.

Thanks for reading!
